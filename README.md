# Bone Fracture Detection from X-ray Images

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for detecting bone fractures from X-ray images. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and can classify images into "Fracture" and "No Fracture."

## Key Features:
- **Fracture Detection**: Classifies X-ray images as "Fracture" or "No Fracture."
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Classifies new X-ray images.

## Technologies Used:
- TensorFlow / Keras for model building
- OpenCV for image processing
- Python

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
